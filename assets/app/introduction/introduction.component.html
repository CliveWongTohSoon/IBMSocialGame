    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p>SpaceRaze is a Star Trek inspired game that uses a player's twitter personality to adjust for different experiences.
    The game uses IBM Watson AI personality insight module to analyse the player's personality through their twitter account.
    It returns a score for each personality attribute in the Five Factor Model and the Theory of Basic Human Values. Then the game
    uses an algorithm to convert these scores into 5 different ship parameters.
        Each ship within a game represents one player.</p>

    <h1> How to play </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Your aim is to find and destroy the other spaceship, before it happens to you! </li>
        <li>The radar system of your ship will detect nearby enemy ships and asteroids by emitting a “ping” noise in the direction which they are coming from, increasing pitch the closer it gets.</li>
        <li>Your ship has the ability to do the following things:
            <ol>
                <li>SHOOT</li>
                <li>MOVE</li>
                <li>TURN - Left/Right </li>
                <li>SHIELD - Front/Back/Left/Right</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li> You have 60 seconds to give a maximum of 3 commands to your crew. Along with the original commands, the ship can also accept some variations of these commands:
            <ol>
                <li>“FIRE” or “BLAST” for “SHOOT”</li>
                <li>“ROTATE” or “SPIN” for “TURN”</li>
                <li>“DEFEND”, “ACTIVATE FORCE FIELD”, “ARMOUR UP”, or “COVER” for “SHIELD”</li>
                <li>“FORWARD” or “STRAIGHT AHEAD” for "MOVE"</li>
            </ol>
            There are several others- feel free to try them!
        </li>
        <li>At the end of the 60 seconds, the commands of both players will be executed.</li>
    </ul>
